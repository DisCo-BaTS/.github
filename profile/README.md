For documentation check out the wiki pages and the READMEs located in the individual repositories.
> Additionally, once the dissertation in which DisCo-BaTS was developed has been successfully defended and published,
> the URL to the corresponding publicly available PDF version will be added here.

## Attribution
If you use the DisCo-BaTS modeling and simulation framework or parts of it for your own research,
it would be appreciated if you would include the following reference in all published work for which
DisCo-BaTS or parts of it where used:
> A citable reference will be added here once the corresponding dissertation has been successfully defended and published.

## Related Repositories

[OpenLVC / poRTIco](https://github.com/openlvc/portico) is utilized as the implementation of the Runtime Infrastructure (RTI)
according to the High Level Architecture (HLA) standard for distributed cooperative simulation coupling in the 
version of 2010 ([IEEE 1516:2010](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1516/3744/)). The version of poRTIco used is `2.1.3`.  
PoRTIco is awesome - go support the maintainers! 💜
